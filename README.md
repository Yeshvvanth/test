# Palindrome REST-API

This repository contains the open source Java code for Palindrome REST API. Documentation can be found at: (http://13.53.136.40:8080/api/v2-docs)

## Steps to setup

### 1. Create an EC2 instance and install Docker, aws-cli.

### 2. Create a role and define an IAM policy with read/write permissions to ECR and attach the role to EC2 instance.

### 3. Clone the repository from the EC2 instance

```
   git clone https://github.com/Yeshvvanth/Palindrome-API.git
```

### 4. Build the image using Dockerfile present in the repo.

```
   sudo docker build -t palindrome .
```

### 5. Login to ECR

```
  aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

-replace <region> <account-id> of your preference

### 6. Tag the built image to ECR url

```
sudo docker tag palindrome:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/palindrome:latest
```

### 7. Push Docker Image to AWS ECR

```
sudo docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/palindrome:latest
```

### 8. To create MySql database

```
sudo docker run --name mysqldb -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> -e MYSQL_DATABASE=palindrome_app -d mysql
```

-replace <region> <account-id> of your preference

### 9. Create DB Table

```
sudo docker exec mysqldb -it sh
```

```
mysql -u root -p
```

```
USE palindrome_app
```

```
CREATE TABLE `message` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `word` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `palindrome` tinyint(2) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

```

```
exit
```

### 10. PUll the image from ECR and RUN the conatiner

```
sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 --name palindrome --link mysqldb -d <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/palindrome:latest
```

### To Access the API

```

```

## Explore Rest Api's

The app defines follwing CRUD APIs.

| METHOD | PATH                      |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| GET    | /api/messages             |
| POST   | /api/messages             |
| DELETE | /api/messages/{messageId} |
| GET    | /api/messages/{messageId} |

## PALINDROME REST API Sequence Diagrams

In the above sections, we have gone through all the components/layers we will be engaging to implement the RESTful service. The next step would be to see how can we use these layers to perform each of the functionalities. A sequence diagram would be a perfect tool to visualize and describe the flow of the process to develop the code. In this section, we will go through the sequence diagrams for each functionality.

### 1. Add Messages API – Sequence Diagram

The below image shows the sequence diagram for the add new message functionality. As you can see, the request comes to the controller; then it goes through the Service layer; finally, it’s handled by the Data Access Object to create the document in the database.

### 2. Get Messages List API – Sequence Diagram

The HTTP GET request will be sent to the controller to get the Messages list. The request query parameters will be parsed to extract any searching, filtering and paging information within the controller.

Then the list of Messages will be retrieved for the search, filter and paging query from the database via the service and model. Finally, the retrieved message list will be sent back to the requester in the response object.

### 3. Delete Messages API – Sequence Diagram

The HTTP DELETE request will be sent to the controller to delete a message. The request comes with the message id which needs to be removed from the database. The controller receives the request and checks if a message exists before initiating the process of deleting a message from the database with the help of service and model components.

### 4. Get Message API – Sequence Diagram

The HTTP GET request will be sent to the controller to get a Message. The request comes with the message id which needs to be retrieved from the database. The controller receives the request and checks if a message exists before returning with the help of service and model components.

## Implementation Architecture

The Restful service is implemented in a layered approach to achieve seperation of concerns.

<kbd> ![alt text](https://github.com/Yeshvvanth/Palindrome-API/blob/feature1/src/main/resources/Images/REST%20architecture.png?raw=true) </kbd>

### 1. Controller

In this API, the controller will handle the request, invoke services to perform that action, and process response to sending back to the requester. Often controller will make a sequence of service calls in orchestration to accomplish the request as designed.

### 2 . Service

This layer handles the business logic related to determing whether a particular message is palindrome or not. Service layer will make use of a utility class to do that. Also, the service will not have access to the request and response object. So anything needs to be done on the request and response object will have to be done in the controller only. This way there is a clear segregation of duties among all the components in the RESTful service.

### 3. Data Access Object (DAO)

This component is the data access layer to fetch and save the documents. The service layer will be invoking the DAO to perform any actions on the document in the database via the DAO.
Typical operations that can be perfomed using this layer are creation, updation, removal and retrieval from the database.

#### Note:

The API is implemented based on the assumption that there are no storage bottlenecks. I have mapped the actions to HTTP methods as listed above. To map the non crud operation (determining whether a string is palindrome or not), the api is restructured to treat the palindrome as an attribute to message resource
This attribute is updated by service layer on POST request such that every message will only be determined whether it's a palindrome or not only once.
